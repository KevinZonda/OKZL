# Open KevinZonda License Framework

## Definition

- OKZML: Open KevinZonda Main License
- OKZSL: Open KevinZonda Sub License

## Background

In 21 century, the world is changing. Considering the increasing of copyright awareness, the need of having a better way to protect the rights of the authors and the users of the software is quick climbing.

To handle this situation, the Open KevinZonda License Framework is developed.

## Structure

Usually, a open-source project will have a license (e.g. MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.). However, sometimes, the restriction of the license is not enough. For example, the project may have a license for the use of the software, but the use of the software is not allowed to be spread through some websites (e.g. CSDN). So our structure is to have one main license (e.g. OKZML, MIT or etc.) of the software for major restriction, and some sub licenses (OKZSL) for restricting detailed part.

In most of time, sub license will not be conflict with main license. However, there are still some conflicting cases. For example, the main license is not allowed sub license, or  is allowed to modify the source code explicitly, but a sub licence is opposite. In this case, usually, we suggest to re-choose the sub license or use a sub license to handle this situation.
